## Reccomendations and Next Steps
- Mens street footwear is consistantly the product with the highest sales throuhgout the year. However it also has the lowest profit margin of all products. Perhaps efforts can be used to increase profit margin of this product as it would have the biggest impact on overall profit for the year.
- West Gear, Foot Locker and Sport Direct account for 70% of total sales for the year 2021. Investigate what makes these retailers so succesful and possibly focus inventory into these retailers.
- Investigate furthur the change in regional sales thoruout the year. Why is there such a noticable change in regions with the top sales throughout the year, specifically the Northeast that has relatively low sales throughout the year compared to other regions, until October, when it becoems the region witht he largest amount of sales. How can we increase sales in the first three quartes of the year for this region?
