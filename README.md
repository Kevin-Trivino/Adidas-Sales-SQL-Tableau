# Adidas Sales Analysis (2021-2023)
This project explores national sales of adidas apparel from 2021–2023 and aims to find insights and trends through different dimensions such as region, product, retailer, and sales method to support business decisions for increasing sales and inventory management. This dataset also contains other metrics such as operating profit, operating margin, and units sold, but for the purpose of the dashboard, the focus will be on sales. Some of the other metrics are explored in the SQL script provided to look for any interesting insights but are not included in the dashboard.

### Retailers
3 of the 6 retailers, West Gear, Foot Locker, and Sports Direct, make up the large majority of all sales, nearly 70%.

### Product
Mens athletic footwear has the highest total sales of all products. However, it also has the lowest profit margin of all products, at around 40%.

### Sales Method
Sales methods seem to stay relatively consistent throughout the year.

## Year vs Year Insights
- Sales increased each year from 2021 to 2023.
- Sales for all three years seemed to follow similar trends, there was a sharp increase starting in October and continuing into December, most likely because of the holiday season.
- Sales for each retailer increased from 2021 to 2022. However, it decreased for every retailer from 2022 to 2023, except for Foot Locker.
- Men's street footwear declined from 2022 to 2023, with an increase in sales for all other products.



## Recommendations and Next Steps
- West Gear, Foot Locker, and Sport Direct account for 70% of total sales in 2023. Investigate what makes these retailers so successful and possibly focus inventory on these retailers.

- Men's street footwear is consistently the product with the highest sales each year. However, it also has the lowest profit margin of all products. Perhaps efforts can be focused on increasing the profit margin of this product, as it would have a high yield effect on overall profit.
- Additionally, investigate why men's footwear was the only product to drop in sales from 2022 to 2023. Is this drop foreshadowing a change in consumer purchase trends, or was it because of an internal issue such as poor product offerings, marketing issues, etc.?
