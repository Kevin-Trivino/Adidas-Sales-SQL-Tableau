# Adidas Sales Analysis (2021-2023)
This project explores national sales of adidas apparel from 2021-2023 and aims to find insights and trends through different dimensions such as region, product, retailer, and sales method to support business decisions for increasing sales and inventory management. This dataset also contains other metrics such as operating profit, operating margin, and units sold, but for the purpose of the dashboard, the focus will be on sales. Some of the other metrics are explored in the SQL script provided to look for any interesting insights but are not included in the dashboard.

## Summary of Insights

### Retailers
3 of the 6 retailers, West Gear, Foot Locker, and Sports Direct, make up the large majority of all sales, nearly 70%.

### Product
Mens athletic footwear has the highest total sales of all products. However, it also has the lowest profit margin of all products, at around 40%.

### Region
From January to September, the West region consistently had the most total sales. The Northeast then becomes the major sales region from October onward. It is unclear why this may be happening.

### Sales Method
Sales methods seem to stay relatively consistent throughout the year.

### Current Year vs Previous Year Sales
Sales for all three years seemed to follow similar trends. Sales began a sharp increase starting in October and continuing into December. Most likely because of the holiday season. It is important to note that although 2021 had the lowest sales until Novemebr compared to 2022 and 2023, it had the highest sales the month of December. 


## Reccomendations and Next Steps
- Mens street footwear is consistently the product with the highest sales throughout the year. However, it also has the lowest profit margin of all products. Perhaps efforts can be focused on increasing the profit margin of this product, as it would have a high yield effect on overall profit.
- West Gear, Foot Locker, and Sport Direct account for 70% of total sales. Investigate what makes these retailers so successful and possibly focus inventory on these retailers.
- Investigate further the change in regional sales throughout the year. Why is there such a noticeable change in regions with the highest sales throughout the year, specifically the Northeast, which has relatively low sales throughout the year compared to other regions, until October, when it becomes the region with the largest amount of sales? How can we increase sales in the first three quarters of the year for this region?
- Investigate furthur why 2021 had the best holiday season sales even though it had worst sales thorughout the year compared to subsequent years. Was caused by internal factors such as positive marketing or promotional factors during that holiday season that can be replicated or if this simply the result of external factors outside of the company?
